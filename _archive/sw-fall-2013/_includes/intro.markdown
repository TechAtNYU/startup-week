#What is Startup Week?
	
What is Startup Week? Startup Week is our trademark week of hacking, networking, demo-ing and learning from the best and brightest in NYC tech. Every semester, we invite founders, investors, and technologists to share their passions with thousands of students.  

Our theme this year is "Startup School" and we will be exploring how technology is disrupting various industries like fashion, music, finance, and investing.
