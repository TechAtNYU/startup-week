But CSS isn't very intuitive and, unless you're an expert, you probably don't understand it that well. Maybe you've found yourself copying and pasting a lot of code from tutorials around the internet, or spending hours trying to get something that should be simple to work. If so, this talk will try to change that. We'll cover the core concepts in CSS—selectors, specificity, the cascade, the position and float models, etc.—so that next time you find yourself confronted with CSS you'll know how to think through the problem.","startDateTime":"2014-04-25T21:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","isApproved":true,"modified":"2014-08-21T01:39:37.951Z","created":"2014-08-21T01:39:37.952Z","isPlaceholder":true,"id":"53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc6","links":{"venue":"53f54dd98d1e62ff12539da7","teams":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc1"],"coorganizers":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc5"],"presenters":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dbb"],"attendees":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539db2","53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dbb"]}},{"title":"Tech@NYU After Hours #3","shortTitle":"After Hours #3","description":"After Hours is an event for designers, developers, and makers to get to know one another and work on cool projects.
