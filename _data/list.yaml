We'll cover the core concepts in CSS—selectors, specificity, the cascade, the position and float models, etc.—so that next time you find yourself confronted with CSS you'll know how to think through the problem.","startDateTime":"2014-04-25T21:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","isApproved":true,"modified":"2014-08-21T01:39:37.951Z","created":"2014-08-21T01:39:37.952Z","id":"53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc6","links":{"venue":"53f54dd98d1e62ff12539da7","teams":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc1"],"coorganizers":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dc5"],"presenters":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dbb"],"attendees":["53f54dd98d1e62ff12539db2","53f54dd98d1e62ff12539dbb"]}},{"title":"Tech@NYU After Hours #3","shortTitle":"After Hours #3","description":"After Hours is an event for designers, developers, and makers to get to know one another and work on cool projects.
